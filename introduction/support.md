## Supported browsers

The template is regularly tested on the following:

* Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari
* Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android
* Desktop, tablet, phone/mobile

We only use standardized and widely-supported HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features, so any other modern, standard-compliant browser such as Opera or Microsoft Edge should also work, even if not explicitly tested.

The following are **NOT** supported, and may result in unexpected look or behavior:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer.
* Smart watches, or any device with a screen width < \~250px.
* Browsers without JavaScript enabled (interactive features won't work).
