# Repo structure

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of this structure is enforced by Jekyll. See [this page of the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) more thorough explanation of some of the items here.
{% endhint %}

## Template vs. user content

The most important distinction to make is between **template content** ("under-the-hood") and **user content** (for your specific website).

**In general**, here's how the files and folders in the template fall into these two categories. We've tried to keep these as separated as possible, within the limitations of Jekyll.

| User content                                                                                                                | Template content                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p><code>/_data</code></p><p><code>/_members</code></p><p><code>/_posts</code></p><p><code>/_styles/-theme.scss</code></p>  | <p>Folders that start with <code>_</code><br><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f448">ðŸ‘ˆ</span> ...except these</p>                                               |
| <p>Folders that start with letters, like...<br><code>/blog</code><br><code>/images</code><br><code>/team</code><br>etc.</p> | Folders that start with `.`                                                                                                                                                             |
| <p><code>_config.yaml</code> (top)<br><code>404.md</code><br><code>index.md</code><br><code>README.md</code></p>            | <p><code>_config.yaml</code> (bottom)<br><code>.gitignore</code><br><code>CITATION.cff</code></p><p><code>Gemfile</code></p><p><code>Gemfile.lock</code><br><code>LICENSE.md</code></p> |

## Images and other assets

The template comes with a default `/images` folder to hold all your site's images, but you can organize your images however you'd like. For example, you could put photos of your team in `/team/photos/` and just refer to them like `team/photos/anna-sun.jpg`.

You could also create `/videos` or any other folders you need for static assets and refer to them in the same way.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only exception to this is your [logo files](use-your-logo.md) and [fallback image](components/figure.md), which the template expects to be in `/images`.
{% endhint %}

## Data and components

The template comes with a few placeholder [data lists](../advanced/data-and-collections.md) and matching [components](components/) for common needs:

| Data/collection                                         | Matching component |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [Citations](citations.md) (`/_data/citations.yaml`)     | `citation`         |
| [Projects](components/card.md) (`/_data/projects.yaml`) | `card`             |
| [Team members](team-members.md) (`/_members`)           | `portrait`         |
| [Blog posts](blog-posts.md) (`/_posts`)                 | `post-excerpt`     |

## Full accounting

A piece-by-piece breakdown of the folders and files in the template. You don't have to [understand the inner workings of all of this](../advanced/background-knowledge.md), but it helps to know generally what each piece is for.

| Folder or file                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
