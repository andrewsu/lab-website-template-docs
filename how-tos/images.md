# Images

The template comes with a default `/images` folder to hold all your site's images, but you can organize your images however you'd like. For example, you could put photos of your team in `/team/photos/` and just refer to them like `team/photos/anna-sun.jpg`. You could also create `/videos` or any other folders you need for static assets and refer to them in the same way.

The only exception is your [logo files](use-your-logo.md), which the template expects to be in `/images`).

To actually insert images into your site, use components like the figure component or the gallery component.
