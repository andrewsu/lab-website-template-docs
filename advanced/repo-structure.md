# Repo structure

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of this structure is enforced by Jekyll. See [this page of the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) more thorough explanation of some of the items here.
{% endhint %}

* **`/_cite`**\
  xxx
* **`/_data`**\
  xxx
* **`/_includes`**\
  Reusable, small snippets of code that can take parameters. This is where the code for components are, if you need to modify them.
*   **`/_layouts`**\
    ``The HTML templates that all pages are built upon.

    `default.html` is the default layout for all pages, and should never really be edited.

    Team member pages and blog post pages have their own layouts in `member.html` and `post.html`, which inherit from `default.html`, and can be edited to add/remove/rearrange sections.
* **`/_members`**\
  xxx
* **`/_posts`**\
  xxx
* **`/_scripts`**\

  You'll only see this if you've built/previewed your site locally.
